## 🛠 Features

### 🖼️ Image & Video Editing
* **Pre-processing:** Grayscaling, Gaussian Blur, Canny Edge Detection, and Dilations.
* **Transformations:** Resizing, cropping, rotating, and Perspective Wrapping.
* **Bitwise Operations:** Masking and combining images for overlay effects.

### 👤 Face Detection & Recognition
* **Haar Cascades:** Real-time detection of faces, eyes, and smiles.
* **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms):** Train the system to recognize specific individuals by name.
* **Deep Learning (DNN):** Implementation of SSD-based face detection for better accuracy in low light.

### 🏃 Motion Detection & Security
* **Frame Differencing:** Identify movement by calculating the absolute difference between frames.
* **Contour Detection:** Automatic bounding-box creation around moving entities.
* **Logging:** Logic to trigger "Record" or "Alert" when motion exceeds a specific threshold.
